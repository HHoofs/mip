class SchedulePlaneMaintenance:
    """
    Class that schedules the maintenance of planes given a set of (required)
    tasks for each plane. These tasks are picked up by a set of workers given
    their qualifications and time required for each task.

    To retrieve the most optimal schedule the model can be optimized.
    The schedule is optimized to maximize the number of planes without any
    remaining task. The output of this model are the deployable planes
    and work schedule following this optimized schedule.

    :param planes: Planes with their associated tasks to be performed
    :param workers: Workers with their associated qualifications
    :param tasks: Task speciationâ€™s, including the required
        qualifications and time for each task to be completed

    Note
    ----
    The qualifications from the tasks and the workers should originate from
    the same set of strings. An incorrect qualification can result in
    unresolved tasks and therefore undeployable planes. The same goes for
    the name of the tasks for each plane and the task names within the
    tasks specifications.

    Example
    -------
    In this example a single plane with a single task is maintained by one of
    two workers. One worker has the required qualifications and can therefore
    perform the task at hand whilst the other is unqualified for this task.
    The former will therefore perform the single vacant task for the plane to
    be maintained.

    >>> scheduler = SchedulePlaneMaintenance(
    ...                 planes={'F16': ['wings']},
    ...                 workers={'Pat': {'a'},
    ...                          'Mat': {'b'}},
    ...                 tasks={'wings': ({'a'}, 1)})
    >>> scheduler.optimize()
    ({'Pat': {'wings'}, 'Mat': set()}, {'F16'})
