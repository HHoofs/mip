class SchedulePlaneMaintenance:
    """
    Class that schedules the maintenance of planes
    given a set of (required) tasks for each plane.
    These tasks are picked up by a set of workers
    given their qualifications and time required
    for each task.

    The scheduler has two stages.The model is build
    after which it can be optimized to retrieve
    the optimal solution.

    The schedule is optimized to maxime the number
    of planes without any remaining task.

    :param planes: Planes with their associated tasks to be performed
    :param workers: Workers with their associated qualifications
    :param working_hours: Maximum time that workers can spend on their tasks

    Example
    -------
    In this example a single plane with a single
    task is maintained by one of two workers.
    One worker has all qualifications and
    can therefore perform each possible task
    whilst the other is unqualified for all tasks.
    The former will therefore perform the single
    vacant task for the plane to be maintained.

    ...                 planes={'F16': ['wings']},
